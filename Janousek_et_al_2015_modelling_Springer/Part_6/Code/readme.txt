# This folder contains code and data for Part VI (Chapters 25 and 26)
# 
# The files are organized in folders as follows:
#
# Complete_code:
# Folder containing complete code for models and plots of chapters 25 and 26 plus common modelling functions. 
# This is a primary resource for thorough exploration of presented models.  
#
# Codeboxes:
# This folder contains files with code snippets from individual Codeboxes in chapters 25 and 26.
# So these are mostly a subset of the code in folder Complete_code. 
# These files stored at Springer's Extra Materials online repository 
# are linked from pdf file (electronic version of the book)   
#
# Figs:
# Folder with code producing figures in chapters 25 and 26. (where applicable). 
# These files stored at Springer's Extra Materials online repository are linked from pdf files.    
#
# Data:
# Folder with geochemical data necessary to run models in chapters 25 and 26. 
# These files stored at Springer's Extra Materials online repository are linked from pdf files.


# NB all the code in Part VI is designed to work within GCDkit, not plain R!
